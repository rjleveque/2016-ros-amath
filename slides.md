# What does Reproducible Research mean?

### .blue[Ability to determine exactly how scientific results were obtained.]

 - Basis of scientific method.

 - Required for confidently building on past results.

 - Critical for accountability in engineering analysis / decision making.

---

template: meaning1

### .red[Standards and best practices in computational/data science are not yet well codified.]

 - Experimental science: Lab notebooks, methodology section of publications, etc.

 - Mathematics: Proofs are required in publications.

Quote from .blue[Reproducible Research: A Cautionary Tale]

By David Crotty, March 26, 2014 on the [scholarly kitchen blog](https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2014/03/26/reproducible-research-a-cautionary-tale/)


.red["If your experiment consists of running numerical data through an algorithm,
then releasing your data and your code allows others to quickly verify that
you’ve done what you’ve said you’ve done.]
But when it comes to other types of research,
wet bench experiments or observational
work for example, reproduction is not quite so simple."

## Outline

 - .blue[Goal:] Stimulate discussion and share ideas  

     - Types of reproducibility
     - Tools for reproducibility

 - .blue[Data:] archiving, curation, sharing
 - .blue[Code:] scripting, versioning, collaborating, sharing, publishing
 - .blue[Publication:] open access

---

name: private1

## Private reproducibility...

Use scripts, not GUIs, for data analysis and visualization.

Use version control / provenance tracking tools.

Archive code and data used for published results.

.blue[Why?]

 - Ability to check results in prior publication,

 - Ability to build on your own past research of your own
   (or students / collaborators).

 -  Easily modify tables/figures to satisfy referees, etc.

---

template: private1

#### .red[Auditable Research:]
Even if code and data are not shared, there should be a
permanent record that can be checked.

.blue[Analogous to lab notebooks.]

---

name: public1

## Public Reproducibility...

Allowing others to reproduce your results.

(Readers, referees, researchers down the hall...)


.blue[Why?]

 -  Verifying scientific integrity of results.

 -  Aids in understanding ideas, implementing methods

 -  Increases impact of work.

## .blue[Compare to Mathematics]

Traditional research in Mathematics is reproducible...

 - A paper containing a new theorem cannot be published without the proof.

---

template: topten1

### .blue[It wasn't always so...]


There is no . . . mathematician so expert in his science, as to place entire
confidence in any truth immediately upon his discovery of it. . . . Every
time he runs over his proofs, his confidence encreases; but still more by
the approbation of his friends; and is raised to its utmost perfection by
the universal assent and applauses of the learned world.

 - [David Hume, 1739](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4705/4705-h/4705-h.htm)

---

## .blue[Compare to Mathematics]

Many arguments against publishing code might be applied to proofs in an
alternate universe...

["Top Ten Reasons To Not Share Your Code (and why you
should anyway)", SIAM News, April, 2013](http://sinews2.siam.org/DetailsPage/tabid/607/ArticleID/386/Top-Ten-Reasons-To-Not-Share-Your-Code-and-why-you-should-anyway.aspx)


 - The proof is too ugly to show anyone else.

 - I didn't work out all the details.

 - I didn't actually prove the theorem - my student did.

 - Giving the proof to my competitors would be unfair to me.

 - The proof is valuable intellectual property.

 - Etc.

### .blue[Making your software available]

The broader open source software community has worked out a lot of the issues
around making code available and broadly useful.

--

- Version control

### .blue[Making your software available]

The broader open source software community has worked out a lot of the issues
around making code available and broadly useful.


- Version control

--

- Automated software testing

---

### Software testing

--

Write code that checks that our code does what we expect it to do

--

We all do this anyway...

--

Formalize this and keep running the tests every time you make changes to the
software

--

[Continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)

### .blue[Making your software available]

The broader open source software community has worked out a lot of the issues
around making code available and broadly useful.


- Version control

- Automated software testing

--

- Software licensing

---

### Things to consider when licensing your code

http://www.astrobetter.com/blog/2014/03/10/the-whys-and-hows-of-licensing-scientific-code/

--

- Code without a license is *closed code*

--

- Use a license that is broadly compatible (*do not make up your own license!*)

--

- Consider using a permissive (e.g, BSD) license, rather than a "copyleft" license

--

### Licensing makes your software useful to others, while maintaining your rights as the creator of the software.

---

### .blue[Making your software available]

The broader open source software community has worked out a lot of the issues
around making code available and broadly useful.


- Version control

- Automated software testing

- Software licensing

--

- Release with semantic versioning

---


### Semantic versioning

Is a way to communicate about your softwares readiness for use by others

--

0.1 => "Here it is! Have fun, but don't expect me to support your particular use, or to keep this API"

--

1.0 => "This is serious, and I intend to keep these APIs around for a while"

--

1.1 => "A few additional features, but API is preserved"

--

2.0 => "We might have broken some of our APIs since 1.1"

--

### http://semver.org/

---

### Make your software citeable!

To proceed in the academic career ladder, we need signals that our work is meaningful and useful

--

Especially pertinent if some aspects of your software work are not captured by traditional peer-reviewed publications

--

.red[**Software papers**] give you a line in your CV, and allow others to cite their dependence on your software (independently from their inspiration by your findings).

--

A collection of links on the topic: http://opcit.eprints.org/oacitation-biblio.html

---

### Baking in reproducibility from the start

--

- Organize your data in a manner that will make sharing easy.

--

- Develop your software using git/Github. Use private repos during development, if you must (https://education.github.com/)

--

- Use tools that facilitate open communication around code, data and results.

---

## Literate programming

### [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)

A notebook format that supports reproducibility by interweaving code, data and
figures.

40 different languages are supported, including Julia, Python and R, and many
others ([Matlab](https://github.com/Calysto/matlab_kernel) too!).

---

## Example

### Code: https://github.com/vistalab/osmosis

### Notebooks: https://github.com/vistalab/osmosis/tree/master/doc/paper_figures

### Data: https://purl.stanford.edu/ng782rw8378

---

## Dependency hell

--

To run these notebooks, you have to install all my dependencies.

--

To reproduce my results, you have to download my code, and my data, to your
machine.

--

If my code has compiled components, you'll need to compile it.

--

If you happen to have a different operating system, different compiler,
different libraries, etc... we might be out of luck!

---

## Tools to mitigate dependency hell

--

### .blue[Virtualization]

 - Package code along with complete environment

 - E.g., VirtualBox, VMware, etc.

 - Docker

--

### .blue[Cloud computing]

 - E.g., Amazon EC2, Windows Azure, etc. + VM

--

### .blue[Web platforms for running code]

 - E.g., RunMyCode.org, wakari.io
 - SageMathCloud: https://cloud.sagemath.com

# Binder

http://mybinder.org

Developed by the <a href="https://www.janelia.org/lab/freeman-lab">Jeremy Freeman's Lab</a> at Janelia Farms

Provisions a GitHub repository as a cloud-computing environment

--

For example, [here](http://mybinder.org/repo/cranmer/ligo-binder) is a binder
that will run the LIGO analysis that confirmed the existence of gravitational
waves (The Github repository is [here](https://github.com/cranmer/ligo-binder)).

---

## Making your publications available

### .red[Publish in open access journals]

--

### .red[Use preprint servers]:

Make your work available *before it is published*

https://arxiv.org/
http://biorxiv.org/

--

Provides access to your work

--

Establishes precedence

---

## When should I preprint?

---

## Summary and conclusions

- Reproducibility is a cornerstone of science.

--

- Think about reproducibility when you start your project and bake it in.

--

- Make your data, code and papers open and available, so that others can build on your work.
